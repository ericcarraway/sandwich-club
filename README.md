# sandwich-club
_Documentation for not spending $200 per month on lunch_

## Overview
Once per week, `sandwich-club` participants travel as a group to HEB.  We purchase groceries for a week's worth of lunches.  At the checkout, we divide the cost by the number of participants.  We aim to spend less than $15 per person.

### Math
| Number of Participants | Contribution per Person | Grocery Budget |
|---|---|---|
| 3 | $15 | $45 |
| 4 | $15 | $60 |
| 5 | $15 | $75 |
