### What?
3-5 software developers purchasing groceries together

### Why?
It solves the problem of spending too much money on expensive unhealthy lunches
(restaurants / food trucks).  Preparing food at home for one person is inconvenient.

### The Gist:
On Mondays, we grocery shop as a team at HEB.  We split the cost by the number of developers
participating in sandwich club that week.  We end up spending about $3 a day for healthy lunches.

### Added Benefit:
The process of problem solving together has made us a much closer team.  As we scale and
continuously improve our approach to lunch, we become better developers.

### Features:
- planning and retrospective meetings (think Agile approach to lunch)
- a dedicated Slack channel for sandwich club communication
- a GitHub repo for HEB receipts, where we keep track of our spending trends over time
(think charts and graphs)
- a website because we want to evangelize the mission of Sandwich Club to other development teams
